1,"As a first time iPhone user, I would say one should definitely buy iPhone ONLY for premium built & premium hardware (will talk later) while the whole iOS experience is pretty overrated. iPhones isn't any exceptionally fast with normal apps like YouTube, Insta etc, Android phones are equally snappy with them in 2022.",Neutral
2,"As a smartphone user since 2015, the reviewer has used Windows, Android, and iOS. They purchased an iPhone on September 26, 2022. The reviewer complained about a paint chip near the screen, but otherwise finds the phone well put together, light to hold, and comfortable. The buttons feel tactile, and the alert slider is a blessing. The phone has IP68 rating and supports HDR and Dolby vision. The dual front-firing speakers are loud and clear. The cameras take good quality photos and videos, and the battery life was stellar on iOS 15 but halved on iOS 16. The A14 bionic chip is powerful, and iOS is a fresh experience, but the system takes a hit in performance and fluidity with iOS 16. The reviewer misses some features from Android, like call recording. 5G works fine, but the phone heats up a bit on iOS 16.",positive
3,"iPhone 12 is a good option for entering the iOS ecosystem. The camera is the best, photos are amazing, and the video quality is even better. Performance is top-notch and iOS is smooth. The display is great, although it may feel small if you're used to Android. Battery life is moderate and file transfer to Android devices can be a hassle. Overall, it's a good device for moderate use.",positive
4,"I migrated to iOS after using Android for more than 8 years. I am a standard mobile user, I do not play games on my phone and neither do I keep browsing social media for ages. The only things that I use my phone are for calling, whatsapp, taking notes, some light photography and watching videos. The most heavily used activity on my phone is watching videos on youtube.With all these activities being done, my weekly average screen on time is 2-3 hours. I am satisfied with the battery life. It has been around 3 months of usage and the battery capacity is still 100%. ",positive

The display is vivid and bright, making everything look great. Overall, the iPhone 12 has been a great purchase and I'm very pleased with it.",positive
